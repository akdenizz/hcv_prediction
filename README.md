# BLOOD DONOR PREDICTION 

* ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ This repo is predict a person can be a blood donor or not depends on the HCV dataset which is published by [UCI's Machine Learning Repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HCV+data)

# HCV Dataset


In this dataset we have 13 features which are;

* Category - 0=Blood Donor, 0s=suspect Blood Donor, 1=Hepatitis, 2=Fibrosis, 3=Cirrhosis
* Age
* Sex - m, f
* ALB - Albumin (protein made by the liver)	
* ALP - Alkaline phosphatase (protein in all body tissues)
* ALT - Alanine transaminase (level of the enzyme)
* AST - Aspartate aminotransferase (level of the enzyme)
* BIL - Bilirubin (yellowish pigment of red blood cells)
* CHE - Cholinesterase (help the nervous system work)
* CHOL	 - Cholesterol 
* CREA - Creatinine (how well the kidneys are performing)
* GGT - Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (enzyme in the liver, kidney, pancreas and brain)
* PROT -  Prothrombin time ( evaluate blood clotting)

# Project Steps

> Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

> Step 2: Load the data which is .csv format

> Step 3: Summarize and visualize the data

> Step 4: Apply the Exploratory Data Analysis

> Step 5: Define Input and Output variable for training

> Step 6: Split into training and testing sets

> Step 7: Evaluating different classification models

> Step 8: Apply the best model on training set

You can see all of this process with the python codes in *HCV_pred.ipynb* file!
